      <description>One of my favorite hobbies in the world is watching movies. Usually, if I stay one week without watching a new film I feel that something is wrong. After watching a movie, I read reviews from different critics on the Internet, to look into different opinions about the movie I just saw or just to learn something new about movies in general. Most of the critics that I read rate their movies using the &amp;ldquo;star&amp;rdquo; rating, where a film gets a rate ranging from one to five stars.</description>

      <description>With Google Summer of Code 2016 coming to an end, it is time to write my final report about it. This was an amazing experience to have. Not only on the technical side, but it has allowed me to meet and interact with awesome people, which helped to improve a lot not only my coding skills, but the way I was interacting with other people inside the community.
Debian Working with Debian was also another high point of the my Google Summer of Code experience.</description>
